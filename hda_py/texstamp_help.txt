"""A tool for interactive texture stamping and image projection."""

The Texture Stamp SOP is a HDA that allows you to procedurally texture any geometry with an unlimited number of quads acting as image projections.

NOTE:
    To use this HDA, both a first input geometry and second input series of quad primitives (as projection planes) with `uv` (default UV set) and `N` (normal) attributes are required.

== Input Attributes ==

These attributes help maintain a procedural workflow when stamping textures onto a geometry.

Prim:
    `stamppath`:
        A string path on disk to a stamp projection texture.

        WARNING:
            This attribute is required to specify multiple texture paths. By default, any input projection prim that does not have this attribute will use the default `error.png` texture.

    `stampcolor`:
        A 3 float vector that multiplies the colour of the stamp projection texture.

@parameters

=== Stamp Controls ===

Use Texture:
    #id: use_bg_texture

    Enables loading a texture from disk as the background for projections and exports.

Background Texture:
    #id: texture_path

    If enabled, specify the path to the background texture.

Default Colour:
    #id: texture_col

    The default background colour for the projection.

BG Colour Space:
    #id: bg_fromspace

    OCIO Colour space for the imported background texture.

Use Default Stamp:
    #id: use_sp_default

    Overrides all stamp projection textures with the current default stamp.

Default Stamp:
    #id: stamppath_default

    The texture path for the default stamp image. This default stamp texture will be used if there is no `s@stamppath` primitive attribute found, or if the `Use Default Stamp` override has been enabled.

Stamp Colour Space:
    #id: s_fromspace

    OCIO Colour space for any imported stamp texture.

Flip Stamp U:
    #id: flip_u

    Flips the UV space horizontally for any imported stamp textures.

Reverse Stamp Normals:
    #id: reverse_normals

    Reverses the projection direction for any input projection grids.

Cull by Dot Product:
    #id: check_uisect

    Enables a projection cull for any textures that go beyond a threshold angle difference.

Cull Ratio:
    #id: alphamult

    Controls the projection cull angle falloff ratio.

=== Output Controls ===

Render:
    #id: execute

    Renders and exports the current texture projection to the current `Output Picture` path.

Resolution:
    #id: res

    The import and export resolution of both the background texture and final product of any stamp projections.
