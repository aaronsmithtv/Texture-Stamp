"""A tool for interactive texture stamping and image projection."""

The Texture Stamp SOP is a HDA that allows you to procedurally texture any geometry with an unlimited number of quads acting as image projections.

@Parameters
=== Stamp Controls ===

Use Texture:
    Enables loading a texture from disk as the background for projections and exports.

Background Texture:
    If enabled, specify the path to the background texture.

BG Colour Space:
    OCIO Colour space for the imported background texture.

Use Default Stamp:
    Overrides all stamp projection textures with the current default stamp.

Default Stamp:
    The texture path for the default stamp image. This default stamp texture will be used if there is no `s@stamppath` primitive attribute found, or if the `Use Default Stamp` override has been enabled.

Stamp Colour Space:
    OCIO Colour space for any imported stamp texture.

Flip Stamp U:
    Flips the UV space horizontally for any imported stamp textures.

Reverse Stamp Normals:
    Reverses the projection direction for any input projection grids.

Cull by Dot Product:
    Enables a projection cull for any textures that go beyond a threshold angle difference.

Cull Ratio:
    Controls the projection cull angle falloff ratio.

=== Output Controls ===

Render:
    Renders and exports the current texture projection to the current `Output Picture` path.
